title:  'NeuronSeg: Neuron Analysis in Calcium Images'
date:   2017-03-01
excerpt: |
    Calcium imaging is a dominant technique in modern neuroscience for measuring neuron populations. This project aims to automate the process of segmentating neurons and extracting signals in calcium imaging. At the same time, the project is also oriented to real-time applications, making interactive experiments possible in the biological laboratories.
