title:  'PheNeSens: Phenotyping of Nematodes with Sensors'
date:   2017-03-01
excerpt: |
    The aim of PheNeSens project is to develop a digital measurement method for the quantification and phenotypic characterization of plant-parasitic nematodes. The approach consists of an automatic image acquisition platform with computer-aided image analysis, which will be able to recognize typical developmental stages of nematodes, to quantify them and to characterize them with regard to phenotyping features.
